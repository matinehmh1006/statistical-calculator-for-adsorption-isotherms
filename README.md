A comprehensive and user-friendly Python tool is developed which uses multiple statistical tests on the data to directly give the maximum coverage (qmax) without the need of fitting numerical models. Throughout the workflow, relevant messages and graphics are shown which guide and update the user at each step. 

This study was conducted as a part of the National Centre for Competence in Research in Digital Fabrication project, funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (project number 51NF40‐141853).

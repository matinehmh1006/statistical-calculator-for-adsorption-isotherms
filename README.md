A comprehensive and user-friendly Python tool is developed which uses multiple statistical tests on the data to directly give the maximum coverage (qmax) without the need of fitting numerical models. Throughout the workflow, relevant messages and graphics are shown which guide and update the user at each step. 

This program is written in Python and requires Python to be installed on the user’s device, or it can be run using an online interpreter.
A few libraries need to be installed by the user prior to running the code (listed in lines 1 to 7). 
The excel file with experimental data (with the same column names as shown in Table. 1) needs to be in the folder where Python code will be saved and ran, and the excel (with .xlsx extension) file’s name and sheet of interest need to be introduced to the code (line 10).
